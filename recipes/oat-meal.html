        <h2>The meal for bodybuilders!</h2>
        <p>Oat meal has undoubtedly many benefits for our body, especially for bodybuilders.</p>
        <p>I personally benefit the most from the amount of carbohydrates available in oats to power my body and energize me before every workout so that I can perform my best at the gym!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oats, obviously. ;D</li>
            <li>Some dried grabes, or your favorite dried fruit.</li>
            <li>A few almonds.</li>
            <li>A banana.</li>
            <li>300ml of milk</li>
            <li>A scoop of your favorite protein powder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps for making the meal</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Simply mix all the ingredients together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Put the meal in a microwave for a while if you love eating it warm. I personally use cold milk and eat it while it is cold!</li>
