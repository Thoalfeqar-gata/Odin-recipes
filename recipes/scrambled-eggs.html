        <h2>Scrambled eggs. A ton of protein basically!</h2>
        <p>For those of you who want a huge amount of protein to give your muscles the building blocks that they need to grow bigger and stronger after a hard workout, you can't go wrong with scrambled eggs!</p>
        <p>A single egg has anywhere between 4-7 grams of protein depending on its size.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 eggs (I usually cook 5 eggs).</li>
            <li>1 tomato.</li>
            <li>150g of diced onions.</li>
            <li>100g of green sweet pepper.</li>
            <li>A teaspoon of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Salt and cumen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the onions until they turn brownish.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato and pepper after dicing them into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Close the lid of the pan and reduce the heat to the lowest. Cook them for about 20min, and add a small amount of water if you think that it is not steamy enough.</li>
            <li>After the moisture dries, add the eggs (make sure to mix them and add the salt and pepper first!)</li>
            <li>Make sure to evenly cook everything by mixing while cooking until the egg reaches the level of softness you like!</li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal sir!</li>
        </ol>
